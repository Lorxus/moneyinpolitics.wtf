      - text: "If you don't think it's fair that billionaires like Donald Trump can run their own self-funded campaigns for president, don't blame the 2010 [Citizens United](/citizens-united/) Supreme Court decision. Blame the 1976 case Buckley v. Valeo instead."

      - text: "In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court wrongly upheld [expenditure](/expenditure/) limits on how much non-candidates could spend on elections, but it rightly held that wealthy individuals like Donald Trump could spend as much as they wanted to spend of their own money on election campaigns."
